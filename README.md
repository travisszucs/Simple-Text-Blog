Simple-Text-Blog
================

This text blog was created as a part of Udacity's CS253 course (Thanks Steve!)!
It was impossible to pass up the chance to get a slightly better understanding of how modern web pages work from Steve Huffman, creator of Hipmunk and Reddit. Not only was the course awesome, but it allowed me to practice my Python skills while teaching more about website infrastructure, cookies, and encryption!

The site was built with Python using jinja2 as a templating library, and Google App Engine to take away any of the back end stress and allow a better focus on the programming details.

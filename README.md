Simple-Text-Blog
================

This text blog was created as a part of Udacity's CS253 course, taught by Steve Huffman. It taught me a 
bit about website infrastructure, cookies, and encryption. The course was taken to practice Python on
a project.

The site was built with Python using jinja2 as a templating library, and Google App Engine to take away any of the back end stress and allow a better focus on the programming details.
